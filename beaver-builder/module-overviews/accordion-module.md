The Accordion module provides a vertical list, and each item in the list can be expanded to display more detail.

Here are some properties of the Accordion module:

* The Accordion module is constructed as a list of items, each with a heading \(called a label\) and a Text Editor section for the body.
* The Label field can include HTML tags. For example, you can choose label size on the Style tab of the module, but adding an  tag around the text changes the label to the default style for that heading.

* The description field is the standard WordPress text editor, so you can add images and format text in the normal fashion.

Tip: You can make the layout in Accordion items more interesting by inserting the shortcode for a saved row or module into the text editor portion of an item. See the Related Article on shortcodes for more information.
