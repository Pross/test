Here are some properties of the Accordion module:

- The Accordion module is constructed as a list of items, each with a heading (called a label) and a Text Editor section for the body.
- The Label field can include HTML tags. For example, you can choose label size on the Style tab of the module, but adding an <h2> tag around the text changes the label to the default style for that heading.

- The description field is the standard WordPress text editor, so you can add images and format text in the normal fashion.

Tip: You can make the layout in Accordion items more interesting by inserting the shortcode for a saved row or module into the text editor portion of an item. See the Related Article on shortcodes for more information.
